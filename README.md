# Dart Exception Handling and Rethrowing

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart related to exception handling, specifically the use of `rethrow` within nested `try-catch` blocks. The example showcases a scenario where an exception is thrown and re-thrown, highlighting the importance of understanding exception flow and potential pitfalls.

## Bug Description

The `bug.dart` file contains a function that simulates an asynchronous operation which might throw an exception.  The exception handling is implemented with nested `try-catch` blocks. While this works, the handling could be more robust, and understanding when and why `rethrow` is used is crucial for correct error propagation and handling.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.dart` file provides an improved version of exception handling. It demonstrates best practices for handling exceptions and offers a more structured approach to managing errors, making debugging and maintenance significantly easier.
